# My solutions to [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) problems (python) 

Exercism is many things: An experiment. A bunch of interesting people. Chaotic. An open source project.

Exercism's tiny toy problems, in the form of automated tests, provide a balance of constraints and freedom. The exercises encourage you to explore trade-offs and best-practices.

Each solution you write is an occasion to ponder readability and code smells. Each solution you review challenges you to articulate your experiences and gut feelings. Each discussion is an opportunity to strengthen your instincts for clean, well-factored code.
